# Hello-world
Just joining, and this is suggested in the guide. Suppose this can be a repository for any intial ideas and projects.
Just getting to grips with the Python porgramming language and linux system file management. Starting to get used to using the Kernel also. I'm doing this in my free time and would appreciate any help along the way. look forward to meeting you all!
